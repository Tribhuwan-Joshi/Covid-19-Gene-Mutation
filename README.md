# Python-Genome

This is a repo created for analyzing mutations on the nucleotides of various genes of Sars Cov-2.
Nucleotides of each genes are read in conveted into Numpy arrrays. The data read into numpy array is then analyzed.
Each gene can be compared against the country wise DNA sequences from NIH website. By doing this kind of a data analysis we can find the mutations associated with each gene.
