# Python-Genome

This is a repo created for analyzing mutations on the nucleotides of various genes of Sars Cov-2.
Two different Nucleotide sequences of Sars Cov-2 are read from the NCBI gene bank. It is then conveted into Numpy arrrays. The data read into numpy array is then analyzed and compared. Each gene from the 2 diffeent sequence can be compared each other. By doing this kind of a data analysis we can find the mutations associated with each gene. This would help the vaccine/drug develelopment efforts to focus on those gene expression that has the least mutation.
